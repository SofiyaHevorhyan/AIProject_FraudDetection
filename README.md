## Getting Started

You don't need to clone this project to run it! However, we are not able to provide you the full data due to the NDA.
The part of the code that you can run is marked with --REPRODUCIBLE PART--. Thus you can check how the saved models perform on the test data.

### Prerequisites

Read more in requirements.txt


### Running the code

For accessing the saved models and test data, click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-TkLaYVBBh9MzRTlkjtEXDHQZ88jtXF?usp=sharing). You need to save it in your Drive in order that Colab could access the files.

After that you should mount your drive in Colab(cell in our notebook with code as below) and run imports(next cell).
You can scroll through the non-reproducible part and still see the code results.

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/')
```
